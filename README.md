## 🌟 Overview  

Welcome to the **Real-Time Retail Analytics Dashboard** 🚀  

This project simulates a **live retail environment** where sales data is continuously generated, analyzed, and visualized in real-time. It provides:  

- 🔄 **Streaming synthetic retail transactions**  
- 📈 **Revenue & performance metrics across dimensions** (stores, products, categories, customers)  
- 🤖 **Anomaly detection with ML (Isolation Forest, DBSCAN)**  
- 🎨 **Interactive dashboards built with Streamlit & Plotly**  

Whether you’re a **data engineer**, **data scientist**, or **retail analyst**, this project gives you hands-on exposure to building **end-to-end real-time data systems**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

### 🎨 Frontend Layer  
- 🖥️ **Streamlit Web Application**: Simple yet powerful dashboard  
- 📊 **Plotly Visualizations**: Interactive charts (time series, bar, scatter, anomaly heatmaps)  
- 📱 **Responsive Layout**: Sidebar for filters & configuration  
- 🔄 **Session State**: Keeps user interactions persistent  

### ⚙️ Data Generation Layer  
- 🏪 **Synthetic Retail Data** via **Faker**  
- 🎯 Configurable parameters (products, stores, customers)  
- 📦 Batch generation & sliding window (last 1000 transactions)  
- ⏱️ Adjustable frequency of data streaming  

### 🧮 Analytics Engine  
- 📊 Multi-dimensional metrics (time, category, store, customer)  
- 📈 Revenue tracking & trend detection  
- 👥 Customer insights & transaction analysis  
- ⚡ Powered by **Pandas DataFrames** for efficient computation  

### 🤖 Anomaly Detection System  
- 🔍 **Isolation Forest** for ML-based anomaly scoring  
- 📏 Statistical thresholds for basic outlier detection  
- ⚙️ Configurable sensitivity (`contamination` factor)  
- 🧠 Feature engineering pipeline for improved detection  

### 🔄 Data Flow  
- 🧵 **Threading**: Background real-time data simulation  
- 🛠️ Event-driven dashboard refresh  
- 🗂️ Memory optimization with data pruning  
- 💾 Session-based state persistence
